1. I started with calculating the Mean value of the counts from the dataset and applied that value staright to the testset. I got a score of 1.583.

2.  Then I started analyzing different attributes of the data set. I plotted graph for (x = hour , y = count, season) and noted this pattern from the graph:

For all the seasons:
  Hour       Count
-------     ----------
0-3 AM 	~30
4-5AM	~0
7-9AM	~350
5-7PM	~500

I hardcoded these values in the test set and my score improved by 0.346 and became 1.237.

I found weather is another important factor affecting the count. I plotted the graph again and found:

Weather     Count (Mean)
--------	----------
1	  205
2	  178
3	  118
4	  164

I hardcoded these values in the test set and my score showed little improvement of 0.01546.

Then I analyzed season vs count and found out:

Season     Count (Mean)
--------	----------
1	  116
2	  215
3	  234
4	  198

I hardcoded these values in the test set and my score showed further little improvement of 0.01315.

3. I implemented rpart and used just few attributes from dataset and default values for cp and minsplit. There was significant improvement in my score.
   Then I added all the attributes to my rpart model. Score improved further.

4. Next I implemented RandomForest with default parameter values. My score improved by 0.14407.
    Then I increased the value of nTree parameter. Score improved further though the improvement was not much.

5. I installed package 'party' and used cforest. cforest is implementation of the random forest and bagging ensemble algorithms utilizing conditional inference trees as base learners.
    I didn't see any improvement with this approach.

6. I used SVM model. This approach did not work so well and score was poor.
    I suspected that poor result is due to overfitting. So I pruned back the tree to avoid overfitting the data. But still there wasn't any improvement.

7 Then I used rpart again and tweaked its parameters.  I tried different values for minsplit and changed class to anova but didn't see improvemen in score.
   I used pruning technique again but no improvement. 
   Then I made cp = 0 and I got my best score of 0.49150
